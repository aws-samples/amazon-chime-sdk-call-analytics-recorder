      "Call: \nSpeaker 0: Hi, thank you for calling Office and More. This is Joan. How can I help you today?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Hi, Joan. We rent our copier from you and um, we've been having some issues. The this like error message keeps coming up saying, um, copier um copier quant quantity. Hang on one second. Let me just pretend I need to print something and it won't print it for me anyway. So it doesn't matter. Ok. Ok. It says\nSpeaker 0: copier\nSpeaker 1: slash print quantity limit reached, but I really thought that we had unlimited copies with our rental. So I'm, I don't know what to do because we're like in the middle of a big project and I can't print it.\nSpeaker 0: Ok. Um I'm so sorry for the inconvenience. Let's see if I can\nSpeaker 1: look it up.\nSpeaker 0: Um, uh, what was your business or your name that we can look you up\nSpeaker 1: on? Oh, I'm just, I'm just the messenger. Um, I will give you the name of the business. Um It's Right Solutions. Our I G H T Solutions and management. We're a property management company.\nSpeaker 0: Ok. Um Do you happen to have the model number\nSpeaker 1: of\nSpeaker 0: the copy on hand?\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Uh-huh, it's K L 14768. Mhm.\nSpeaker 0: Ok, wonderful. Thanks for that. Ok, and I can see that Solutions has been a customer of us for the past five years. So thank you so much for continuing to do business with\nSpeaker 1: us.\nSpeaker 0: Let's see if I can look into that. Ok. Ok. So I'm seeing here on our end that the last four years you all had the unlimited uh but I'm seeing here that this most\nSpeaker 1: recent\nSpeaker 0: year that would not be so you can have\nSpeaker 1: a. Ok, awesome. So is that something that I can bring you over the phone or is that attached to the contract?\nSpeaker 0: Um So that is in, so we have here that a Benjamin Rogerson was the one who signed that contract and so\nSpeaker 1: we need to\nSpeaker 0: work directly with Benjamin uh to amend that contract. I don't think, I think I can do over the phone with you.\nSpeaker 1: Ok, cool. Well, um Benjamin. Ok, so Benjamin actually doesn't work here anymore. Um and I, I can try and figure out how to contact him but like he's not. So is there any way to, to change, just change the contract under someone else's name or does he have to sign off like it basically, is this something he should have done before you left? Um No, that's\nSpeaker 0: fine. Um We can probably. Ok. Uh Are you, are you a management company?\nSpeaker 1: Uh Yeah, I am. Well, right now.\nSpeaker 0: Ok. Um Well, if perhaps you could get us something with like y'all official letterhead, maybe scan to us just saying that Benjamin isn't in the position anymore, letting us know who the\nSpeaker 1: new\nSpeaker 0: point of contact is. We,\nSpeaker 1: ok? You\nSpeaker 0: can go ahead and give the permission and that new person to adjust contracts that Benjamin signed off on. Um But until we have that I can have anyone else this\nSpeaker 1: contract got it. Ok? I understand. Um, but we don't have it. Ok. So this is like a, this is not your fault, but we don't have anybody in his position yet. His, his departure was abrupt, put it that way. And uh, so I don't have like if I send you a letter head right now, it'll say basically I have to talk to my boss', boss who is not currently in town about somebody who does not currently work here anymore. So it sounds like for right now we're probably stuck and I should probably get on the phone with like the office depot or something like that for printing for today. Is that about how it works?\nSpeaker 0: Unfortunately, yes, until we get um, we can talk to him next. But yeah, unfortunately.\nSpeaker 1: Ok, frustrating. Ok. Um ok, I will do that and then, and once we have that you need the, the letterhead with it signed off. This is so and so I'm the one in charge and then we can have it. All right.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Correct and you can\nSpeaker 1: just email\nSpeaker 0: our customer service email address or you can fax that to us whichever is more convenient to you.\nSpeaker 1: Ok. All right. Ok. Well, thanks for trying. I appreciate it.\nSpeaker 0: Ok, so I can be of more help. Alright.\nSpeaker 1: Uh Alright, have a good day. You\nSpeaker 0: too.\nSpeaker 1: Bye bye.\n\n\nWhat is the customer calling about and what are the next steps?"
